# lab-computational-geometry
Lab at the Computation Geometry Group in summer term 2017 for University of Bonn.

We implemented and visualized two different algorithmic problems. The algorithms are from the paper "Best Laid Plans of Lions and Men" by Mikkel Abrahamsen et. al. from University of Copenhagen, Denmark.
